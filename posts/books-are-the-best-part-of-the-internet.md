The internet can be viewed as the the most modern source of information for humans. But is it the best medium for all use-cases? Let's say you want to learn about topic XY, is it the best use of your time to type `topic XY` in your favorite search bar and open up a million tabs?

## Similarities
* Links: Good books have their references listed in some form and thus place themselves in the graph of written works.

## Differences
* Eye strain: For me personally at least it is less straining to my eyes to read a physical book or e-Reader, than reading from a LCD computer screen.
* The internet pulls your thoughts in a million different directions, books require focused attention but guide it through a continuous path. 
* Distraction is further amplified by quantitatively more and qualitatively more aggressive forms of advertisement on the internet.
* Completeness of information: There must be a huge "dark era" of 20th century information that is still protected by copyright. I mean content of books that have been published in the 20th century but whose content wasn't digitized and thus is inacessible to the internet user.

## More Thoughts
* Attention is more and more seen as a resource (find references)
* You can use the internet to find books :P
